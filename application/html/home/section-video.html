                    <p>Replace this text with some meaningful stuff later. Its time that the students who got the
                        evaluation over in the first slot submit their finalized seminar report. Create the seminar
                        report, get it approved by your guide; then upload the PDF copy to your drive; share it just
                        like the previous seminar related documents. Add the link to the shared sheet of links
                        related to seminar. Once you do this, inform me so that I can add it to the department
                        records. Simultaneously its evaluation will be done by us. Finalized marks of seminar will
                        be released through course page grade book </p>
